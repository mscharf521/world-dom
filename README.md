#Development Notes

2/24/2025
The frontend was rebuilt using latest version of Vite and React. The dependencies for using the Google Maps API were not updated and it is using some older features that may be deprecated in the future.
The backend was rearchitected to be serverless using AWS API Gateway, AWS Lambda functions and DynamoDB. This architecture lowers costs and is much more scalable compared to the previous Node.js/Express backend with state data stored in memory. There are still some data efficiency improvements that can be made to decrease overall costs. Also, if the WebSocket connnection is lost, reconnection is not supported.
